## Story

[Roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) are one of the oldest
types of video games. The earliest ones were made in the 70s, and they were inspired
a lot by tabletop RPGs. Roguelikes usually have the following features in common.

- They are tile-based.
- **They rely heavily on procedural generation: Levels, monster placement, items, and so on
  are randomized, so the game does not get boring.**
- The game is divided into turns, that is, you take one action, then the other
  entities (monsters, allies, and so on, controlled by the CPU) take one.
- The task is usually to explore a labyrinth and retrieve some treasure from its
  bottom.
- They feature permadeath: if you die, it's game over, you need to start from the
  beginning again.

## Description:

A remake of the very popular old game called Dungeon Crawler, where players navigate a new, **_unique maze every time they play_**, fighting various creatures, solving puzzles, and collecting items for future use in the game.
